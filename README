# The Mini Music Box
The Mini Music Box contains three tools for musicians to use anywhere at any time because it fits in your pocket.

The 13-key piano has three separate octaves. Begins at middle C and can go one octave above and below.

The guitar tuner plays repeated drone sounds for EADGBE. Switches are arranged in the shape of the headstock.

The metronome is capable of subdividing the tempos (perfect for cut time, 6/8, 9/8, 12/8, etc.)

Core Data saves settings of the piano octave and the BPM set by the user in the metronome.

Future plans
-------------
- Different tunings for guitar (multiple standard / drop tunings)
- More octaves for keyboard
- Mastering the art of the AutoLayout
