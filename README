The Mini Music Box contains three tools for musicians can use anywhere at anytime.

The 13-key piano has three separate octaves. Begins at middle C and can go one octave above and below.

The guitar tuner plays repeated drone sounds for EADGBE. Switches are arranged in the shape of the headstock for beginner guitarists.

The metronome is... a metronome.

Future plans for after 1.0
--------------------------
- Subdividing tempos of the metronome (eight notes, triplet eights, sixteenth notes, quintuplets...)
- Different tunings for guitar (multiple standard / drop tunings)
- More octaves for keyboard
